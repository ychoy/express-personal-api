##  
This is my personal API on my favorite camping trips. View it live at http://powerful-hollows-02954.herokuapp.com

## Features
* **JSON API** Endpoints
* **REST-ful Routes** (GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE)
* At least one **CRUD-able resource** (Create, Read, Update, Destroy)
* and an `/api/profile` endpoint with some basic details about me.


## Future Features
* Consume API using AJAX
* Rend the results on the page using jQuery
* Deploying to Heroku
* Profile info stretch goals
    * Add a `daysOld` field that calculates how many days old you are.
    * Add an `isAwake` field that's only `true` between 8am and 10pm!
* CRUD resource stretch goals
    * Use query parameters to filter results from one of your CRUD endpoints:
        - e.g. `?limit=2`  
    * Create a `/search` endpoint
        - e.g. `?q=mad+men`  
        - e.g. `?type=romance`
